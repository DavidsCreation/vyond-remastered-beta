Vyond Remastered, is, and will always remain, being a fully open source and modifyable piece of software. 
When we release new versions, they will be fully open for people to change and contribute to, and I ENCOURAGE people to add more fixes and features in their own, private builds. 
Vyond Remastered is a community project, and will remain open as long as the developers and I see fit. 
We deeply encourage (friendly) competition, but are also very much against corporatisation of the Legacy Video Maker, I'm talking about you, anistick creator! 
Vyond Remastered will always be free and no donation options will be avaliable for this specific project, you can only donate your time and paitence as the developers do their job and as we add the features that people love the most.

From this day on, 4th February, 2024, I officially announce the Vyond Remastered project as FOSS software. Take this statement as you will.

Have a brilliant day, and happy editing!
- David's Creation (Owner of the Vyond Remastered project)
